<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hey there! I'm Ariel Jovellanos Lazo, and I love being Web Developer. I've
  been doing it for 1 year and gotten really good at Web Developing. I'm all
  about making a difference and being creative, especially in lively work
  setups. I'm proud of the cool stuff I've achieved, like Creating my First
  Website, and some projects."

  Outside work, I'm into playing chess, reading books and watching more stuff
  about programming, which keeps me happy and inspired. I believe in having a
  balanced life, and that spills over into how I approach my job, making me more
  creative.

<p>
  I'm super excited to connect with others who love what they do and want to
  make a positive impact. Let's chat about our shared interests and how we can
  team up to make cool things happen. Whether it's talking about what we love or
  solving problems in a fresh way, I'm pumped about the awesome things that can
  come from collaborating. Drop me a message, and let's start a conversation
  that could lead to some awesome connections and cool projects!
